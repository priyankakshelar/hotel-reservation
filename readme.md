# Hotel Reservation

## Requirements
I am a real estate investor who has recently purchased a property at the beach. I want to rent this propery to try and generate some revenue. The goal of the applicaiton I am hiring you to build is to take reservations for the property.  All reservations should be a minimum of one week (7 days) always starting on a Saturday (checkin) and end on the following Saturday (checkout).  I really don't care what the UI/front end looks like.  It just needs to be usable.  It is only one room, so only 1 person can have it reserved at one time (no overlapping reservations).  The potential customers need to be able to look for availalbe weeks so that they can view avaialbe dates.  The customer should also be able to see all the dates that are already booked.  The cost of the room is $1500 a week and will not change.   I also need to collect the information about the customer once they find a week that works for them.  Each customer should be assisgned a customer number.  I also want to give my customers a view to lookup a reservation by a reservation number and potentially cancel the reservation.  The lookup/cancel of a reservation should require the customer to enter the reservation number as well as the customer number.
